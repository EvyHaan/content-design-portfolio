                  <h2>Content Design Philosophy</h2>
                  <p class="body-regular"><em>Communicate from the head, the heart, time, & space.</em></p>
                  <p class="body-regular">Concepts are tinged with emotions and imagination. They develop over time from
                    countless
                    experiences. One concept could be understood a thousand ways depending on who is examining it and
                    the nuances they bring.
                  </p>
                  <p class="body-regular">Communication starts with listening. It is the most effective when the
                    foundation is understanding
                    how someone else understands.

                  <h2>Journey to UX</h2>
                  <p class="body-regular">Like many Content Designers, I have a background in something unexpected.

                  </p>
                  <p class="body-regular">After receiving a B.S. of Community Health, I spent several years in the
                    public health & non-profit sectors. I became interested in how new tech was able to share health
                    data in insightful ways. So I switched careers to something completely unfamiliar: software
                    engineering.
                  </p>
                  <p class="body-regular">I was introduced to UX while working as a software engineer building out
                    features of a vehicle head unit interface. It was inspiring to see intuitive experiences artfully
                    constructed for such a constraint-laden space.
                  </p>

                  <p class="body-regular">Growing up, I’ve always been interested in how concepts are communicated.
                    While English is my native language, it was one of my parents' second. I am amazed at the
                    flexibility and tickled by the nuances of different forms of communicating. There’s a power not just
                    in words, but also in the context in which those words exist. How we communicate can be empowering
                    or excluding.</p>

                  <p class="body-regular">When I discovered the UX writing / content design / content strategy space, I
                    was excited to make another career jump. I have loved diving into the psychology of communicating in
                    the digital space, human-computer interaction, and dabbling with concepts of ontology.</p>
