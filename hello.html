          <h2>A bit about me...</h2>
          <p>I enjoy making things organized, efficient, and streamlined with a little something extra to bring about a
            smile.
            <br />
            <br />
            Like many Content Designers, I have a background in something unexpected.
            <br />
            <br />
            After receiving a B.S. of Community Health, I spent several years in the public health & non-profit sectors.
            I
            became interested in how new tech was able to share health data in insightful ways. So I switched careers to
            something completely unfamiliar: software engineering.
            <br />
            <br />
            I was introduced to UX while working as a software engineer building out features of a vehicle head unit
            interface. It was inspiring to see intuitive experiences artfully constructed for such a constraint-laden
            space.
            <br />
            <br />
            While English is my first language, it was one of my parents' second. So growing up, I’ve always been
            interested in how concepts are communicated. There’s a power not just in words, but also in
            the context in which those words exist. How we communicate can be empowering or excluding.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, here I am to write better experiences for everyone.
