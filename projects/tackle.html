          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <br />
          <p>While reviewing the website for Tackle.io, I noticed the CTA for the newsletter sign-up form had text
            spilling onto a second line. Looking a little closer, I noticed other ways I might suggest to improve
            that form. As I scanned through the rest of the website I noticed two other forms, each with a slightly
            different design.</p>

          <p>In this redesign proposal, my goals are to:</p>
          <ol class="indent">
            <li>Continuity across the website forms</li>
            <li>Improve error copy</li>
            <li>Pose considerations for accessibility</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>These are the forms I address:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Newsletter Sign-up</li>
            <li>Sign in with email</li>
            <li>Schedule a demo</li>
          </ul>

          <hr />
          <h2>Understand</h2>
          <br />
          <p>Below are the current forms.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">

            </figure>
          </div>

          <h3>Observations</h3>
          <p><em>Design.</em></p>
          <p>Thinking about continuity, I used a spreadsheet to compare the component elements across the forms.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/tackle/t_component_comparison.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 4. Component element comparison.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>I also logged all the error messages. Most messages are generic and do not give the user helpful context
            (“Please complete this required field”). The copy could be improved to sound a little less mechanical.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/tackle/t_error_messages.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 5. Error messaging.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>Key takeaways:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>The float labels seem to be a good solution for including labels/placeholder text.</li>
            <li>The “Sign in with email” CTA needs to be style-matched to the rest of the website.</li>
            <li>The “Newsletter sign up” CTA text needs to be on one line.</li>
            <li>Sentence casing needs to be applied consistently across each component element.</li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <p><em>Development.</em></p>
          <p>Using the inspector tool in the browser, I can see a little of how the designs have been programmatically
            implemented.</p>

          <p>Specifically, I wanted to understand if there was a programmatic reason the CTA text on the Newsletter
            Sign Up form was on two lines because it seemed so close but slightly inconsistent to the design.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/tackle/t_nsu_cta_em.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 6a. Original “Sign Up” on two lines with font-size: 1em.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>I learned that while other CTA text had a set font-size: 14px, this CTA had a responsive font-size:
            1em. In most browsers, 1em is equivalent to 16px.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Resizing the font to 14px brought the text onto one line.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/tackle/t_nsu_cta_px.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 6b. Tweaking font-size to 14px (.875ems).</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>Key takeaway:</p>
          <p>I understood this to mean there may be opportunity for cross-collaboration between design and development
            teams to discuss and mutually define dimension values.</p>

          <br />
          <p><em>Accessibility.</em></p>
          <p>I had some immediate thoughts around accessibility when first viewing the forms:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Two of the forms do not have labels</li>
            <li>One of the forms does not have placeholder, hint, or instruction text</li>
            <liOn the Sign In with Email form, the “Forgot password” text does not have good contrast></liOn>
            <li>One form has placeholder text that disappears when the input field is focused
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>I used the WAVE accessibility evaluation extension for more accessibility insights relevant to content.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/tackle/t_wave_nsu.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 7. The WAVE view of the Newsletter Sign Up form.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p> Notes from the Newsletter Sign Up form:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>The instruction text above the form also does not have great contrast</li>
            <li>There are a few noscript tags, which may be hiding content from assistive technology like screen readers
            </li>
          </ul>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/tackle/t_wave_sad.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 8. The WAVE view of the Schedule a Demo form.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>Notes from the Schedule a Demo form:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Labels are well-used in most instances</li>
            <li>Again, there are a few noscript tags, potentially hiding content</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/tackle/t_wave_siwe.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 9. The WAVE view of the Sign In with Email screen.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>Notes from the Sign In with Email form:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Labels are not present</li>
            <li>Confirmed low contrast of “Forget password?” text</li>
          </ul>
          <br />

          <p>I found these findings were generally framed around visual impairment and assistive technology. I had
            questions about other potential users.</p>
          <br />

          <p>What if the user is neurodivergent? They may not have visual impairments, but could still benefit from
            constant labels and placeholders.</p>
          <br />

          <p>Or perhaps a user is generally not very tech savvy? Or they use the keyboard tab to quickly switch fields
            and don’t have a chance to see placeholder text before it disappears. These forms are relatively basic. But
            thinking big-picture, forms may be more complex elsewhere on the site and require more careful crafting of
            labels, placeholder text, and instruction copy. This ties back into the idea of sitewide consistency.</p>

          <hr />
          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Goal 1 - Consistency across the website forms</h3>
          <p>After an in-depth review of these different fields, a few recommendations to improve consistency are: </p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Include labels for all form fields visible above their input fields</li>
            <li>Visible labels provides a natural contextual space if any additional instruction needs to be provided
              for a user to complete that field in lieu of placeholder text</li>
            <li>If placeholder text is used, it should have consistent casing</li>
            <li>Convert font-size dimensions from pixels to ems for resizability by users</li>
          </ul>
          <br />

          <h3>Goal 2 - Improve error copy</h3>
          <p>I revised the error messages that I had logged. Knowing the users of the site are business-minded, I wanted
            the voice to come across as professional and succinct. The tone needed to be direct, but a step short of
            being mechanical. And I aimed to include some context to each error. These are my suggestions.</p>
          <br />
          <p>There were two particularly challenging errors:</p>
          <br />
          <p><strong><em>Incorrect format - phone number.</em></strong> This field is challenging on three levels.
            First, it should allow for international phone numbers. Second, it should allow for extensions. Third, it
            should not be over-restrictive on how users input their phone numbers. However, given the current error
            message, I could use the allowable characters and still receive an error message. I aimed to add a little
            more specificity in how to use certain special characters.</p>
          <br />
          <p><strong><em>Correct email format, incorrect password.</em></strong> Rather than stating when an email or a
            password is invalid or incorrectly formatted, the error waits to validate both. The payoff of error
            specificity for improved UX versus security measures is still in debate. Because the form is small enough, I
            am ok with the ambiguous error message with a few caveats:</p>
          <br />
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>The wording be improved to not tell the user they are “wrong”</li>
            <li>An additional error message if the email format is incorrect</li>
            <li>Additional error messages if the email or password fields are left blank</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h3>Goal 3 - Accessibility considerations</h3>

          <p>I really only touched on surface-level accessibility uses. Many of the recommendations around what I
            observed would be addressed by the recommendations around consistency across all website forms. The only
            additional point would be addressing any color contrast issues.</p>

          <hr />
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <br />

          <p>I was motivated to take a deeper look into the UX writing aspects of the forms on Tackle’s website because
            of the two-lined “Sign Up” CTA on the Newsletter Sign Up form. I could see what was intended by design, but
            I could also see what potentially was mis-implemented in the development side. Once I dug into the
            development side of things, it started a chain of questions around accessibility and usability.</p>
          <br />
          <p>That is what compelled me to write a mini case study about these forms. The most important thing I gained
            from this exercise were the questions I had at the intersections of UX writing, accessibility, and
            development. Great UX isn’t achieved by any one of these teams alone, but when these teams collaborate.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Even the recommendations I pose here, still feel tentative without having those questions answered.
            There is still room for continual iteration and improvement. There is much more to research. There is still
            more to consider.</p>
