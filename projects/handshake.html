          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <br />
          <p>Handshake is a (fictional) new project management and payments app for freelancers and business owners.
            While still in early design iterations, a main priority is to develop and document a content strategy from
            the outset.</p>
          <br />
          <p>I was tasked with the following deliverables:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>A style guide</li>
            <li>Revise UX copy</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>I addressed the immediate task in 4 phases. To set the project up for success, I planned for a
            collaboration phase as a next step.</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li><a class="link" href="#hs-understand">Understand</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" href="#hs-research">Research</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" href="#hs-ideate">Ideate</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" href="#hs-revise">Revise</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" href="#hs-collaborate">Collaborate</a></li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>Considering the upcoming design review, I needed to accomplish these with minimal changes to the
            interactions and flows. Any flaws would be addressed in future iterations.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The outcome was a personable, yet professional voice that is embodied by new UX copy on the Handshake app
            and well-documented for continued development.</p>

          <br />
          <p>The Handshake app supports collaboration between freelancers and business owners. Both groups use the same
            app but experience different flows targeted to their needs.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">

          <p>Actions for freelancers:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Set a pay rate</li>
            <li>Propose a budget</li>
            <li>Track hours</li>
            <li>Send invoices</li>
            <li>Communicate about the project</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="screenshot">

              <img src="../images/HSpersona_po.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 2. Small business owner persona, provided by the designer.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>Actions for business owners:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Define project details & features</li>
            <li>Approve a budget proposal</li>
            <li>Review time reports</li>
            <li>View invoices</li>
            <li>Send payments</li>
            <li>Communicate about the project</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>Both parties may bring very different experiences and perspectives to the app. Other questions I
            considered:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Do they have experience with this type of working relationship? How much?</li>
            <li>How experienced are they in their own position?</li>
            <li>Are they technically savvy?</li>
            <li>Have they tried other similar apps? Was it a positive or negative experience?</li>
            <li>What is the physical setting where they may use the app?</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>With the users in mind, I walked through the initial design mockups. I noted the objective of each section
            and the main goal each page conveyed. These sections were:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Welcome</li>
            <li>Onboarding - freelancer</li>
            <li>Onboarding - business owner</li>
            <li>Project dashboard - freelancer
              <ul class="indent">
                <li>Project details</li>
                <li>Time reporting</li>
                <li>Invoicing center</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Project dashboard - business owner
              <ul class="indent">
                <li>Project details</li>
                <li>Time reviewing</li>
                <li>Payments center</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Messaging center - freelancer</li>
            <li>Messaging center - business owner</li>
          </ul>

          <hr />
          <h2 id="hs-research">Phase 2: Research</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Competitive Analysis: Honeybook, Fiverr, & Upwork</h3>
          <br />
          <p>I conducted a competitive analysis to find out:</p>
          <ol class="indent">
            <li>The language used in the industry by competitor apps and end-users</li>
            <li>Common formatting or styling challenges to anticipate</li>
            <li>If/how the personality of each app was conveyed by the competitor</li>
            <li>How the end-users connected with that personality</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>Honeybook, Fiverr Workspace, and Upwork stood out as the top competitors based on audience, primary
            function, features, and popularity.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Analysis of each app happened in two parts:</p>
          <br />
          <p>First, I stepped through any freely accessible onboarding and features screens. This gave me a feel for
            each app’s content design decisions, especially around formatting dates, numbers, costs, phrase structuring,
            and sentence casing. I also got a feel for the language used to connect with the user.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Second, I scanned reviews of the app. I looked for reviews where users described themselves, their
            collaboration partnership, and their work to understand the terminology of the freelance industry. I also
            looked for points of friction or delight related to specific copy or “personality traits” of the app.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Of all the findings, two stood out:</p>
          <ol class="indent">
            <li>Freelancers often described themselves as running their own business. This blurred the distinction
              between Handshake’s two audiences. I would need to redefine the roles for clarity.</li>
            <li>Only one competitor had a well-defined persona. Its consistent presence was highly effective. Defining a
              clear voice and tone would be crucial for Handshake to build a relationship with its users.</li>
          </ol>

          <hr />
          <h2>Phase 3: Ideate</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Meet Casey: the voice & tone of Handshake</h3>
          <br />
          <p>If the user was their own CEO, they needed an executive assistant. That was the inspiring idea for “Casey”,
            who would be the spokesperson - the voice - Handshake.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img src="../images/HSvoice_who_is.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 3. Meet Casey, the persona for Handshake.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>Casey would provide the right information in the right amount at the right time. They provide ambient
            support, preemptively giving key information without being obtrusive. Casey is someone who is
            <strong><em>organized</em></strong> and <strong><em>transparent</em></strong> while being
            <strong><em>approachable</em></strong> with a <strong><em>bright</em></strong> positivity. These traits
            inspired the guiding principles and became the voice.
          </p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img src="../images/HSvoice_if_you_met.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 4. The voice charactorists of Casey.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <div class="screenshot">

              <figcaption>Fig 5. Guiding principles to sound like Casey.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>Casey’s tone adapts to the user’s needs on two ranges: <strong><em>Supporting-to-Guiding</em></strong> and
            <strong><em>Serious-to-Playful</em></strong>.
          </p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img src="../images/HSvoice_looks_like.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 6. Defining Casey's tonal ranges.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>Intersecting these ranges, I charted 13 interface touch points across a tonal schematic.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img src="../images/ToneMap.drawio.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 7. Map of touchpoints across intersecting tonal ranges.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>On the <em>Supporting-to-Guiding</em> range, most points leaned toward being supporting. This gives the
            user the most autonomy with the goal of seamlessly integrating into their daily workflow. Casey only takes
            the lead when asked or to navigate precarious situations.</p>
          <br />
          <p>On the <em>Serious-to-Playful</em> range, the touchpoints were fairly balanced. Worth noting, most
            “playful” interactions are infrequent or short-lived. Examples are feature tours in onboarding, or empty
            states. Conversely, copy that was viewed regularly, like instruction text, or copy that needed careful
            review, like warnings, needed to offer transparency and a direct way forward.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>Style Guide: a blueprint for consistency</h3>
          <br />
          <p>Consistency builds trust and confidence. These ideas are at the heart of the app.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Considering the early state of the product, I considered long-term impacts. Two questions guided my
            decisions:</p>
          <ol class="indent">
            <li>How can I develop guidelines that both enforce consistency in this early iteration while leaving room
              for Handshake to mature over time?</li>
            <li>What can I anticipate now that will alleviate future style and formatting challenges?</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>The governing rules for component styles and copy formatting were designed to be basic. I included examples
            for easy reference.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">

            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>I kept in mind potential new features, regional markets, translation and localization, inclusivity, and
            accessibility. These ideas guided decisions for the present presentation of information.</p>

          <hr />
          <h2 id="hs-revise">Phase 4: Revise</h2>
          <br />
          <p>Revisions happened in three stages:</p>
          <ol class="indent">
            <li>A first fast-pass to change all the text. This quick rephrasing exercise helped me grasp what the
              designer intended each section of copy to convey. I noted anything that was unclear or felt unorganized.
            </li>
            <li>A second pass to closer align the copy and components to the style guidelines.</li>
            <li>A third pass to make final adjustments, revisit the intended goal for each screen, and review for a
              cohesive personality presence across the app.</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <h3>Revision highlights</h3>
          <br />
          <p><strong>Welcome Screen.</strong> The welcome screen was a fairly blank slate. The important thing to
            convey was the benefits Handshake offers. Another addition was the name of the app for brand
            recognition.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img src="../images/HS_welcome_before.svg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 10a. Original Welcome screen.</figcaption>

              <figcaption>Fig 10b. Revised Welcome screen.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p><strong>Sign In / Sign Up Screen.</strong> The mock-ups included a single screen that contained both flows.
            I proposed separating the flows, to reduce user cognitive load. Then I made minor adjustments of adding
            labels, placeholders, and a revised version of the password microcopy. I decided to use "Create an account"
            instead of "Sign up" to add a visual difference and reduce the chance of a user entering the wrong flow. The
            brand name was left at the top of these screens to continue to build recognition while the user is not yet
            inside the app.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">

            </figure>
          </div>

          <p><strong>Select Role.</strong> The onboarding screens is where the user really begins to interact with
            Handshake as an entity. To emphasize this, the language is conversational and engaging.</p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>

            </figure>
          </div>

          <p id="hs-invoice-screen"><strong>Dashboard - Invoice screen.</strong> A major challenge with this screen was
            the lack of clarity of the information. The section headings were broad, and it wasn't apparent if or how
            the invoices were organized. I surmised that the top section were unpaid (open) invoices, and the bottom
            contained a history of paid invoices. I noted to follow up with the designer and PM on this.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The invoice details also felt haphazard and not easily scannable. I transformed number-oriented data into
            formats outlined in the styleguide. This served to make the items more scannable, readable, and consistent.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>It was also worth noting that the "Send a message" action feels out of place. Additionally, it is out of
            sync with the parallel screen for the freelancer flow. I address this in a suggested redesign of the
            dashboard. <a class="link" href="#hs-proposed-dash-redesign">View the proposed redesign...</a></p>

          <h3>Proposed New Screens and Layouts.</h3>
          <br />
          <p><strong>New screen: User dashboard.</strong> One screen that was missing from the mock-ups was a space
            where a user could manage all their projects. I submitted a proposal for the designer and PM to review. </p>

          <div class="screenshot">
            <figure>
              <img src="../images/HS_proposed_user_dash.svg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 14a. Proposed new screen: User Dashboard.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p id="hs-proposed-dash-redesign"><strong>Revised Layout: Project dashboard.</strong> The primary concern for
            the project dashboard was the navigability and universal actions. Including the project title above the
            pager bar lets the user know which project they are viewing at all times. Above the title, navigation
            returns the user to the specified screen. User and project menus are also included in this space.
            Altogether, these changes add missing interaction and user orientation. <a class="link"

          <br />
          <p>Where interactions, flows, or actions were not clear, I posed questions for the designer or product manager
            to understand the mechanics or goals. I proposed solutions to friction points or anticipated feature
            integration issues. I also highlighted where we may need to cross-collaborate with other teams, bringing in
            spokespeople from legal, marketing, engineering, localization, and research. Their expertise would be
            critical to inform the decisions and forecast feasibility.</p>
          <br />
          <p>One goal for this project was to make the progress trackable and easy to contribute to. I created a project
            board. Tickets had well-defined acceptance criteria and story points. I organized all project files in a
            Google Drive directory. Additionally, I implemented versioning for the style guide to track design decisions
            overtime.</p>

          <h2 id="hs-reflection">Reflection</h2>
          <p>At first, I found it challenging to integrate my objectives as the team’s UX Writer into designs that were
            already mocked up. I had to shift my mindset into a real-life setting of collaboration and iteration. With
            that lens I was able to move forward.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Without the constraints of the project, some things I would do differently or add:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Map the information architecture (IA)</li>
            <li>Redesign screens based on the new IA</li>
            <li>Expand the style guide into a larger content design system</li>
            <li>Develop a testing strategy</li>
            <li>And of course, have continuous conversations with team members for the best forward momentum</li>
          </ul>
