          <h2>Project Type</h2>
          <p>Practice design challenge</p>
          <br />
          <h2>Duration</h2>
          <p>Jan 2022, 3 weeks</p>
          <br />
          <h2>Role</h2>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Handshake is a (fictional) new project management and payments app for freelancers and business owners.
            While still in early design iterations, a main priority is to develop and document a content strategy from
            the outset.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The designer for the Handshake App provided mock-ups for an initial review with the Head of UX and VP of
            Product. To help the designer prepare for the design review, I was tasked with updating the text to build a
            better relationship with users. This included <i><strong></strong>developing the voice & tone for
              Handshake</strong></i>,
            <i><strong>creating a style guide</strong></i>, and <i><strong>editing the copy</strong></i>.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>After <i><strong>conducting a competitor analysis</strong></i> to better understand the industry and the
            app’s niche, I
            <i><strong>crafted a persona</strong></i> that would “be” Handshake. These helped define guiding principles
            and guide content
            revisions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>The outcome: a personable, yet professional voice that is embodied in the new copy and documented for
            continued development.

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>Handshake supports the working relationship between freelancers and business owners. Although both parties
            use the same app, they have different needs. Freelancers are the primary audience, using the app for billing
            and progress reporting. Business owners use the app to track progress and make payments. Within the app,
            both types of user can define project features, negotiate budget and timeline, and send messages.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>The challenge is to design UX copy that is consistent across both user flows while still being flexible in
            supporting the unique tasks of both types of users.
          </p>

          <hr />
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>The very first thing I did was walk through each screen. I tried to determine what was the goal of the
            page. I wrote all questions and thoughts that came to mind about UI elements, interaction flows, and the
            clarity of the information presented.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>DISCOVERY</h3>
          <br />
          <p>I was unfamiliar with the freelancing industry. I chose to conduct a competitive analysis, to find out:</p>
          <br />
          <p class="indent">1. the language used in the industry by competitor apps and end-users</p>
          <p class="indent">2. common formatting or styling challenges to anticipate</p>
          <p class="indent">3. if/how each competitor app conveyed the personality of their app</p>
          <p class="indent">4. how the end-users connected with that personality</p>
          <br />
          <p>I searched for competitor apps highlighted in freelancer resource blogs. Three apps stood out as direct
            competitors based on 1) audience, 2) primary function, 3) features, and 4) popularity. These were Honeybook,
            Fiverr Workspace, and Upwork.</p>
          <br />
          <p>First, I stepped through any freely accessible onboarding steps or features to get a feel for the app’s
            personality and piece together a rationale behind their content design decisions.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Next, I scanned reviews of the app over the previous year to understand how users described themselves,
            their collaboration partners, and their work. I also noted points of friction or delight related to specific
            copy or personality traits.</p>
          <br />
          <p>A major finding was that freelancers often described themselves as running their own business. This
            blurring of the line between Handshake’s audiences simplified the process for developing character traits
            for the app.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Another finding was that only one competitor had an obvious, well-defined product persona. Its consistent
            presence was effective. This meant that defining a clear voice would be crucial for Handshake.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>IDEATION</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Voice</h4>
          <p>I created “Casey”, a product persona to embody the Handshake app. If the user was their own CEO, Casey was
            to be their executive assistant. Casey would provide only the right information in the right amount at the
            right time, while also being available for extra support as needed. Casey is someone who is organized and
            transparent while being approachable with a bright positivity.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>Tone</h4>
          <p>I defined two tonal ranges to show how Casey might adapt to user needs. The first range was
            supporting-to-guiding, and the second from playful-to-serious. Intersecting these ranges, I charted 13
            interface touchpoints a user would experience.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The majority of touchpoints lean toward being supporting, giving the user the most control, and only taking
            the lead when asked or needed. The touchpoints were equal in the playful-to-serious range. Most interactions
            that could be playful were either short-lived or infrequent, i.e. feature tours or empty states. Conversely,
            informational copy needed to be ambient, while help or warning copy needed to be direct.</p>
          <br />
          <h4>Style Guide</h4>
          <p>Getting Handshake’s personality right was important. Conveying it consistently would make or break the
            relationship with the user. Consistency builds trust and confidence.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Considering the early stage of the product, I considered long-term impacts. Two questions guided my
            decisions:</p>
          <br />
          <p class="indent">1. How can I develop guidelines that both enforce consistency in this early iteration while
            leaving room
            for
            Handshake to mature over time?</p>
          <p class="indent">2. What can I plan for now that will ease future style and formatting challenges?</p>
          <br />
          <p>To answer the first question, the governing rules for component styles and copy formatting were fairly
            banal. They are concise without being restrictive. I included examples for easy reference.</p>
          <br />
          <p>For the second question, I kept in mind potential new features, regional markets, translation and
            localization, inclusivity, and accessibility. I allowed these to guide current decisions for the present
            presentation of information.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>DESIGN</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Mockup text revisions</h4>
          <p>It was finally time to revise the text. I did this in three stages:</p>
          <br />
          <p class="indent">1. A first pass to speed through and change all the text. This rephrasing exercise helped me
            grasp what the
            designer intended to convey by each section of text.</p>
          <p class="indent">2. A second pass to revise the text and copy components within the voice and style
            guidelines.</p>
          <p class="indent">3. A third pass to make any final adjustments, revisit the intended meaning for each screen,
            and review for
            a cohesive personality presence across the app.</p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>WRAP-UP</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Managing team relationships</h4>
          <p>Where interactions and flows were not clear, I asked for clarity from the designer or product manager. I
            proposed solutions to friction points or anticipated feature integration issues. I also highlighted where we
            may need to cross-collaborate with other teams, bringing in spokespeople from legal, marketing, engineering,
            localization, and research. Their expertise would be critical to inform the decisions and forecast
            feasibility, especially at this early stage.</p>
          <br />
          <h4>Testing & Analytics</h4>
          <p>While I did not create a full testing strategy, I came across a few elements of copy that gave me pause
            about the best text to choose. I made decisions based on quick word usage via Google Analytics, but noted
            alternate options that may be worth A/B testing.</p>
          <br />
          <h4>Documentation</h4>
          <h5>Project Board</h5>
          <p>To track project progress, I created a project board on Trello. Breaking down the entire project into
            manageable tasks helped keep the project moving, and gave me a space to organize to-dos and celebrate
            milestones.</p>
          <br />
          <h5>Organization</h5>
          <p>Throughout the process, I maintained a Google Drive directory that included all the files relevant to the
            project. This provided visibility to all documents, processes, and decisions. With this, any team member
            could feel confident about contributing to the project.</p>
          <br />
          <h5>Versioning</h5>
          <p>As I revised copy, some decisions I had made in the style guide were no longer applicable. This arose from
            how the designs introduced concepts, new concept taxonomies I hadn’t yet anticipated, or the constraints of
            the available space. I didn’t want to simply change the style guide. I wanted to document the changes and
            provide a rationale to serve as a reference. I introduced document versioning to govern protocols for making
            changes from minor typo fixes, to large revisions requiring new releases.</p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This was the final project for the Fundamentals of UX Writing course offered by the UX Content Collective,
            and my first real sleeves-rolled-up plunge into the daily work of a UX writer. The aim was to update the
            copy to better connect with and serve the user, without changing interactions or flows.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>What I found most challenging was working within concept designs that were incomplete. Often the
            interactions and flows had glaring flaws. For being a solo project, this was a great exercise in team
            collaboration. It made me consider how I would want to communicate with my team about product decisions
            from the position of their expertise, and how important it was to articulate my own design decisions.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>What surprised me was actually seeing the impact of content-early design at the start of a product. The
            mock-ups already existed. But there were many times I wanted to change the entire layout to make the copy
            more organized on the screens. It made me appreciate the importance of being involved in defining the
            information hierarchy and user research processes.</p>
