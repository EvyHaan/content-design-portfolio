          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <br />
          <p>Handshake is a (fictional) new project management and payments app for freelancers and business owners.
            While still in early design iterations, a main priority is to develop and document a content strategy from
            the outset.</p>
          <br />
          <p>I was tasked with the following deliverables:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>A style guide</li>
            <li>Revise UX copy</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>I addressed the immediate task in 4 phases. To set the project up for success, I planned for a
            collaboration phase as a next step.</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li><a class="link" href="#hs-understand">Understand</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" href="#hs-research">Research</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" href="#hs-ideate">Ideate</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" href="#hs-revise">Revise</a></li>
            <li><a class="link" href="#hs-collaborate">Collaborate</a></li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>Considering the upcoming design review, I needed to accomplish these with minimal changes to the
            interactions and flows. Any flaws would be addressed in future iterations.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The outcome was a personable, yet professional voice that is embodied by new UX copy on the Handshake app
            and well-documented for continued development.</p>

          <h2 id="hs-understand">Phase 1: Understand</h2>
          <br />
          <p>The Handshake app supports collaboration between freelancers and business owners. Both groups use the same
            app but experience different flows targeted to their needs.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Actions for freelancers:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Set a pay rate</li>
            <li>Propose a budget</li>
            <li>Track hours</li>
            <li>Send invoices</li>
            <li>Communicate about the project</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>Actions for business owners:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Define project details & features</li>
            <li>Approve a budget proposal</li>
            <li>Review time reports</li>
            <li>View invoices</li>
            <li>Send payments</li>
            <li>Communicate about the project</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>Both parties may bring very different experiences and perspectives to the app. Other questions I
            considered:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Do they have experience with this type of working relationship? How much?</li>
            <li>How experienced are they in their own position?</li>
            <li>Are they technically savvy?</li>
            <li>Have they tried other similar apps? Was it a positive or negative experience?</li>
            <li>What is the physical setting where they may use the app?</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>With the users in mind, I walked through the initial design mockups. I noted the objective of each section
            and the main goal each page conveyed. These sections were:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Welcome</li>
            <li>Onboarding - freelancer</li>
            <li>Onboarding - business owner</li>
            <li>Project dashboard - freelancer
              <ul class="indent">
                <li>Project details</li>
                <li>Time reporting</li>
                <li>Invoicing center</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Project dashboard - business owner
              <ul class="indent">
                <li>Project details</li>
                <li>Time reviewing</li>
                <li>Payments center</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Messaging center - freelancer</li>
            <li>Messaging center - business owner</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="hs-research">Phase 2: Research</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Competitive Analysis: Honeybook, Fiverr, & Upwork</h3>
          <br />
          <p>I conducted a competitive analysis to find out:</p>
          <ol class="indent">
            <li>The language used in the industry by competitor apps and end-users</li>
            <li>Common formatting or styling challenges to anticipate</li>
            <li>If/how the personality of each app was conveyed by the competitor</li>
            <li>How the end-users connected with that personality</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>Honeybook, Fiverr Workspace, and Upwork stood out as the top competitors based on audience, primary
            function, features, and popularity.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Analysis of each app happened in two parts:</p>
          <br />
          <p>First, I stepped through any freely accessible onboarding and features screens. This gave me a feel for
            each app’s content design decisions, especially around formatting dates, numbers, costs, phrase structuring,
            and sentence casing. I also got a feel for the language used to connect with the user.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Second, I scanned reviews of the app. I looked for reviews where users described themselves, their
            collaboration partnership, and their work to understand the terminology of the freelance industry. I also
            looked for points of friction or delight related to specific copy or “personality traits” of the app.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Of all the findings, two stood out:</p>
          <ol class="indent">
            <li>Freelancers often described themselves as running their own business. This blurred the distinction
              between Handshake’s two audiences. I would need to redefine the roles for clarity.</li>
            <li>Only one competitor had a well-defined persona. Its consistent presence was highly effective. Defining a
              clear voice and tone would be crucial for Handshake to build a relationship with its users.</li>
          </ol>

          <hr />
          <h2>Phase 3: Ideate</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Meet Casey: the voice & tone of Handshake</h3>
          <br />
          <p>If the user was their own CEO, they needed an executive assistant. That was the inspiring idea for “Casey”,
            who would be the spokesperson - the voice - Handshake.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Casey would provide the right information in the right amount at the right time. They provide ambient
            support, preemptively giving key information without being obtrusive. Casey is someone who is
            <strong><em>organized</em></strong> and <strong><em>transparent</em></strong> while being
            <strong><em>approachable</em></strong> with a <strong><em>bright</em></strong> positivity. These traits
            inspired the guiding principles and became the voice.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Casey’s tone adapts to the user’s needs on two ranges: <strong><em>Supporting-to-Guiding</em></strong> and
            <strong><em>Serious-to-Playful</em></strong>.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Intersecting these ranges, I charted 13 interface touch points across a tonal schematic.</p>
          <br />
          <p>On the <em>Supporting-to-Guiding</em> range, most points leaned toward being supporting. This gives the
            user the most autonomy with the goal of seamlessly integrating into their daily workflow. Casey only takes
            the lead when asked or to navigate precarious situations.</p>
          <br />
          <p>On the <em>Serious-to-Playful</em> range, the touchpoints were fairly balanced. Worth noting, most
            “playful” interactions are infrequent or short-lived. Examples are feature tours in onboarding, or empty
            states. Conversely, copy that was viewed regularly, like instruction text, or copy that needed careful
            review, like warnings, needed to offer transparency and a direct way forward.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>Style Guide: a blueprint for consistency</h3>
          <br />
          <p>Consistency builds trust and confidence. These ideas are at the heart of the app.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Considering the early state of the product, I considered long-term impacts. Two questions guided my
            decisions:</p>
          <ol class="indent">
            <li>How can I develop guidelines that both enforce consistency in this early iteration while leaving room
              for Handshake to mature over time?</li>
            <li>What can I anticipate now that will alleviate future style and formatting challenges?</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>The governing rules for component styles and copy formatting were designed to be basic. I included examples
            for easy reference.</p>
          <br />
          <p>I kept in mind potential new features, regional markets, translation and localization, inclusivity, and
            accessibility. These ideas guided decisions for the present presentation of information.</p>

          <hr />
          <h2 id="hs-revise">Phase 4: Revise</h2>
          <br />
          <p>Revisions happened in three stages:</p>
          <ol class="indent">
            <li>A first fast-pass to change all the text. This quick rephrasing exercise helped me grasp what the
              designer intended each section of copy to convey. I noted anything that was unclear or felt unorganized.
            </li>
            <li>A second pass to closer align the copy and components to the style guidelines.</li>
            <li>A third pass to make final adjustments, revisit the intended goal for each screen, and review for a
              cohesive personality presence across the app.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The following are some highlights.</p>

          <hr />
          <h2 id="hs-collaborate">Phase 5: Collaborate on next steps</h2>
          <br />
          <p>Where interactions, flows, or actions were not clear, I posed questions for the designer or product manager
            to understand the mechanics or goals. I proposed solutions to friction points or anticipated feature
            integration issues. I also highlighted where we may need to cross-collaborate with other teams, bringing in
            spokespeople from legal, marketing, engineering, localization, and research. Their expertise would be
            critical to inform the decisions and forecast feasibility.</p>
          <br />
          <p>One goal for this project was to make the progress trackable and easy to contribute to. I created a project
            board. Tickets had well-defined acceptance criteria and story points. I organized all project files in a
            Google Drive directory. Additionally, I implemented versioning for the style guide to track design decisions
            overtime.</p>

          <hr />
          <h2 id="hs-reflection">Reflection</h2>
          <p>At first, I found it challenging to integrate my objectives as the team’s UX Writer into designs that were
            already mocked up. I had to shift my mindset into a real-life setting of collaboration and iteration. With
            that lens I was able to move forward.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Without the constraints of the project, some things I would do differently or add:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Map the information architecture (IA)</li>
            <li>Redesign screens based on the new IA</li>
            <li>Expand the style guide into a larger content design system</li>
            <li>Develop a testing strategy</li>
            <li>And of course, have continuous conversations with team members for the best forward momentum</li>
          </ul>

            <p>Fig 9. Where the designer saw this as the "next" screen to signing up for the app, this really served
              as the start of several onboarding screens. Subsequent screens are oriented around the selected role,
              although still parallel in flow. I also softened the title to be more inquisitive rather than
              interrogative, as to more closely reflect the tone of Handshake. The instruction text did not directly
              relate to the immediate question so I removed it.
              <br />
              The terms "freelancer" and "project owner" were chosen based on findings from the competitive analysis.
              The primary audience strongly identified themselves as "freelancers", but also as business owners in their
              own right. I maintained "freelancer" for familiarity. The frequently stated alternative for "business
              owner" was "client". However, the Handhsake team felt it set a mood of imbalance, rather than one of
              collaboration. Additionally, freelancers may have thier own projects they hire out for. With this
              in mind, I pitched "project owner" for future discussion by the team.

            <p>Fig 10. First, I made the title parallel for both types of users. Financials may be an uncomfortable
              topic, so Handshakes introduces it in a confident and matter-of-fact yet conversational way. Additional
              microcopy tells the user that their payment details will be expected next, so they can get those ready.
              Asterisks on each option signaled the designer should include a tooltip. Here, the tooltips would let the
              user know processing times for each payment method. It was also important to call out legal terms of
              service agreements. I added copy on the screen for the relevant user, but requested the Handshake team set
              a meeting with the in-house legal team to determine appropriate terms of service communication.

            <p>Fig 11. The project dashboard is parallel for each user, but contains slightly different information
              based on the user's role. I re-labeled this section "invoices" for continuity between the two views.
              Concise but descriptive section headers and field labels improved the scannability. Date and cost formats
              were also revised for improved readability. The CTA buttons were revised according to the styleguide.
              <br />
              It is also important to call out here that the information being presented is unclear. I requested a
              meeting with the designer and project manager to clarify the heirarchy around how to present the invoices
              in different states, including created, sent, awaiting payment, and paid.

            <p>Fig 12. After a user sends an invoice, they have the ability to cancel it. The dialog was confusing. I
              added a clear title, with a CTA that clearly stated the action and matched the language of the title. The
              description was simplified to clearly state what would happen.</p>

            <p>Fig 13. The project messaging center is another parallel screen in both user flows. My main suggestion to
              the designer was that we revamp this screen completely in a future iteration, but I wanted to first
              understand thier rationale for the current designs. There are established emailing and messages
              conventions that we could safely assume are familiar to the user and we can take advantage of.
              <br />
              To support the present designs, I removed the project title since this is a screen already living within
              the specified project dashboard. I clarified the section headings and made them consistent across both
              flows, as well as added empty state copy.

            <p>Fig 14. The provided designs did not include a screen displaying all the projects a user might have in
              progress. I pitched a mock-up of an idea for this screen. By greeting the user by name, it adds a layer of
              familiarity to the user's relationship with Handshake. On this screen the user is able to view key details
              of a project at a glance, sort projects, and complete quick actions.

            <p>Fig 15. I proposed a redesign of the project dashboard to support continuity across flows and address
              navigation issues in the original design. This included adding the project title above the pagination
              tabs so the user always knows what project they are working in. The tab labels serve as proxies for screen
              titles. Above the title, are navigation, the account menu, and project-wide actions. Below the tabs, many
              of the original design layouts are maintained.</p>
