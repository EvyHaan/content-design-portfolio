          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Handshake is a (fictional) new project management and payments app for freelancers and business owners.
            While still in early design iterations, a main priority is to develop and document a content strategy from
            the outset.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The designer for the Handshake App provided mock-ups for an initial review with the Head of UX and VP of
            Product. To help the designer prepare for the design review, I was tasked with updating the text to build a
            better relationship with users. This included <i><strong>developing the voice & tone for
                Handshake</strong></i>, <i><strong>creating a style guide</strong></i>, and <i><strong>editing the
                copy</strong></i>.</p>
          <br />
          <p>After <i><strong>conducting a competitor analysis</strong></i> to better understand the industry and the
            app’s niche, I <i><strong>crafted a persona</strong></i> that would “be” Handshake. These helped define
            guiding principles and guide content revisions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>The outcome: a personable, yet professional voice that is embodied in the new copy and documented for
            continued development.</p>

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>Handshake supports the working relationship between freelancers and business owners. Although both parties
            use the same app, they have different needs. Freelancers are the primary audience, using the app for billing
            and progress reporting. Business owners use the app to track progress and make payments. Within the app,
            both types of user can define project features, negotiate budget and timeline, and send messages.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The challenge is to design UX copy that is consistent across both user flows while still being flexible in
            supporting the unique tasks of both types of users.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Additionally, with the upcoming high-level design review, I needed to avoid making significant flow and
            interraction changes. Those would come in later iterations.</p>

          <hr />
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>DISCOVERY</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Design documents review</h4>
          <p>The designer provided a target audience personas, an overview of the app goals and features, and a
            first-iteration mockup. I started by reviewing the personas to get into the mindset of the end-user.</p>

          <figure class="proj-img-single">
            <img src="../images/HSpersona_fr.png" />
            <figcaption>

          <figure class="proj-img-single">

            <figcaption>
              <p>Fig 2. Small business owner persona, provided by the designer.</p>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>With the personas in mind, I walked through the screens to determine the goal for each. I wrote all
            questions and thoughts that came to mind about UI elements, interaction flows, and the clarity of the
            information presented.</p>
          <br />
          <h4>Competitor analysis</h4>
          <p>I was unfamiliar with the freelancing industry. I chose to conduct a competitive analysis, to find out:</p>
          <br />
          <p class="indent">1. the language used in the industry by competitor apps and end-users</p>
          <p class="indent">2. common formatting or styling challenges to anticipate</p>
          <p class="indent">3. if/how each competitor app conveyed the personality of their app</p>
          <p class="indent">4. how the end-users connected with that personality</p>
          <br />
          <p>I searched for competitor apps highlighted in freelancer resource blogs. Three apps stood out as direct
            competitors based on audience, primary function, features, and popularity. These were Honeybook, Fiverr
            Workspace, and Upwork.</p>
          <br />
          <p>First, I stepped through any freely accessible onboarding steps or features to get a feel for the app’s
            personality and piece together a rationale behind their content design decisions.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Next, I scanned reviews of the app over the previous year to understand how users described themselves,
            their collaboration partners, and their work. I also noted points of friction or delight related to specific
            copy or personality traits.</p>
          <br />
          <p>A major finding was that freelancers often described themselves as running their own business. This
            blurring of the line between Handshake’s audiences simplified the process for developing character traits
            for the app.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Another finding was that only one competitor had an obvious, well-defined product persona. Its consistent
            presence was effective. This meant that defining a clear voice would be crucial for Handshake.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>IDEATION</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Voice</h4>
          <p>I created “Casey”, a product persona to embody the Handshake app. If the user was their own CEO, Casey was
            to be their executive assistant. Casey would provide only the right information in the right amount at the
            right time, while also being available for extra support as needed. Casey is someone who is
            <i><strong>organized</strong></i> and
            <i><strong>transparent</strong></i> while being <i><strong>approachable</strong></i> with a
            <i><strong>bright</strong></i> positivity.

            <p>Fig 3. Slide deck introducing Casey, the voice & tone of Handshake</p>
          </div>

          <h4>Tone</h4>
          <p>I defined two tonal ranges to show how Casey might adapt to user needs. The first range was
            <i><strong>supporting-to-guiding</strong></i>, and the second from
            <i><strong>playful-to-serious</strong></i>. Intersecting these ranges, I charted 13
            interface touchpoints a user would experience.
          </p>

          <figure class="proj-img-single">
            <img src="../images/ToneMap.drawio.png" />
            <figcaption>
              <p>Fig 4. Map of touchpoints across intersecting tonal ranges.</p>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>The majority of touchpoints lean toward being supporting, giving the user the most control, and only taking
            the lead when asked or needed. The touchpoints were equal in the playful-to-serious range. Most interactions
            that could be playful were either short-lived or infrequent, i.e. feature tours or empty states. Conversely,
            informational copy needed to be ambient, while help or warning copy needed to be direct.</p>
          <br />
          <h4>Style guide</h4>
          <p>Getting Handshake’s personality right was important. Conveying it consistently would make or break the
            relationship with the user. Consistency builds trust and confidence.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Considering the early stage of the product, I considered long-term impacts. Two questions guided my
            decisions:</p>
          <br />
          <p class="indent">1. How can I develop guidelines that both enforce consistency in this early iteration while
            leaving room for Handshake to mature over time?</p>
          <p class="indent">2. What can I plan for now that will ease future style and formatting challenges?</p>
          <br />
          <p>To answer the first question, the governing rules for component styles and copy formatting stayed fairly
            banal. They are concise without being restrictive. I included examples for easy reference.</p>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>For the second question, I kept in mind potential new features, regional markets, translation and
            localization, inclusivity, and accessibility. I allowed these to guide current decisions for the present
            presentation of information.</p>

          <h3>DESIGN</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Mockup revisions</h4>
          <p>It was finally time to revise the text. I did this in three stages:</p>
          <br />
          <p class="indent">1. A first pass to speed through and change all the text. This rephrasing exercise helped me
            grasp what the designer intended to convey by each section of text.</p>
          <p class="indent">2. A second pass to revise the text and copy components within the voice and style
            guidelines.</p>
          <p class="indent">3. A third pass to make any final adjustments, revisit the intended meaning for each screen,
            and review for a cohesive personality presence across the app.</p>

              account" over "Sign in" to reduce cognitive load by the added visual distinction. Additionally, I added
              redirecting links in case the user needed to switch flow tracks. The microcopy for the password was
              simplified. Input labels & hints as well as a CTA were added to each flow.</p>

            <p>Fig 9. Where the designer saw this as the "next" screen to signing up for the app, this really served
              as the start of several onboarding screens. Subsequent screens are oriented around the selected role,
              although still parallel in flow. I also softened the title to be more inquisitive rather than
              interrogative, as to more closely reflect the tone of Handshake. The instruction text did not directly
              relate to the immediate question so I removed it.
              <br />
              The terms "freelancer" and "project owner" were chosen based on findings from the competitive analysis.
              The primary audience strongly identified themselves as "freelancers", but also as business owners in their
              own right. I maintained "freelancer" for familiarity. The frequently stated alternative for "business
              owner" was "client". However, the Handhsake team felt it set a mood of imbalance, rather than one of
              collaboration. Additionally, freelancers may have thier own projects they hire out for. With this
              in mind, I pitched "project owner" for future discussion by the team.

            <p>Fig 10. First, I made the title parallel for both types of users. Financials may be an uncomfortable
              topic, so Handshakes introduces it in a confident and matter-of-fact yet conversational way. Additional
              microcopy tells the user that their payment details will be expected next, so they can get those ready.
              Asterisks on each option signaled the designer should include a tooltip. Here, the tooltips would let the
              user know processing times for each payment method. It was also important to call out legal terms of
              service agreements. I added copy on the screen for the relevant user, but requested the Handshake team set
              a meeting with the in-house legal team to determine appropriate terms of service communication.

            <p>Fig 11. The project dashboard is parallel for each user, but contains slightly different information
              based on the user's role. I re-labeled this section "invoices" for continuity between the two views.
              Concise but descriptive section headers and field labels improved the scannability. Date and cost formats
              were also revised for improved readability. The CTA buttons were revised according to the styleguide.
              <br />
              It is also important to call out here that the information being presented is unclear. I requested a
              meeting with the designer and project manager to clarify the heirarchy around how to present the invoices
              in different states, including created, sent, awaiting payment, and paid.

            <p>Fig 12. After a user sends an invoice, they have the ability to cancel it. The dialog was confusing. I
              added a clear title, with a CTA that clearly stated the action and matched the language of the title. The
              description was simplified to clearly state what would happen.</p>

            <p>Fig 13. The project messaging center is another parallel screen in both user flows. My main suggestion to
              the designer was that we revamp this screen completely in a future iteration, but I wanted to first
              understand thier rationale for the current designs. There are established emailing and messages
              conventions that we could safely assume are familiar to the user and we can take advantage of.
              <br />
              To support the present designs, I removed the project title since this is a screen already living within
              the specified project dashboard. I clarified the section headings and made them consistent across both
              flows, as well as added empty state copy.

            <p>Fig 14. The provided designs did not include a screen displaying all the projects a user might have in
              progress. I pitched a mock-up of an idea for this screen. By greeting the user by name, it adds a layer of
              familiarity to the user's relationship with Handshake. On this screen the user is able to view key details
              of a project at a glance, sort projects, and complete quick actions.

            <p>Fig 15. I proposed a redesign of the project dashboard to support continuity across flows and address
              navigation issues in the original design. This included adding the project title above the pagination
              tabs so the user always knows what project they are working in. The tab labels serve as proxies for screen
              titles. Above the title, are navigation, the account menu, and project-wide actions. Below the tabs, many
              of the original design layouts are maintained.</p>

          <h3>WRAP-UP</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Managing team relationships</h4>
          <p>Where interactions and flows were not clear, I asked for clarity from the designer or product manager. I
            proposed solutions to friction points or anticipated feature integration issues. I also highlighted where
            we
            may need to cross-collaborate with other teams, bringing in spokespeople from legal, marketing,
            engineering,
            localization, and research. Their expertise would be critical to inform the decisions and forecast
            feasibility, especially at this early stage.</p>
          <br />
          <h4>Testing & Analytics</h4>
          <p>While I did not create a full testing strategy, I came across a few elements of copy that gave me pause
            about the best text to choose. I made decisions based on quick word usage via Google Analytics, but noted
            alternate options that may be worth A/B testing.</p>
          <br />
          <h4>Documentation</h4>
          <h5>Project Board</h5>
          <p>To track project progress, I created a project board on Trello. Breaking down the entire project into
            manageable tasks helped keep the project moving, and gave me a space to organize to-dos and celebrate
            milestones.</p>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h5>Organization</h5>
          <p>Throughout the process, I maintained a Google Drive directory that included all the files relevant to the
            project. This provided visibility to all documents, processes, and decisions. With this, any team member
            could feel confident about contributing to the project.</p>
          <br />
          <h5>Versioning</h5>
          <p>As I revised copy, some decisions I had made in the style guide were no longer applicable. I didn’t want
            to
            simply change the style guide. I wanted to document the changes and provide a rationale to serve as a
            reference. I introduced document versioning to govern protocols for making changes ranging from minor typo
            fixes, to large revisions requiring new releases.</p>

          <h2 id="handshake-reflection">Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This was the final project for the Fundamentals of UX Writing course offered by the UX Content Collective
            and my first real sleeves-rolled-up plunge into the daily work of a UX writer. The aim was to update the
            copy to better connect with and serve the user, without changing interactions or flows.</p>
          <br />
          <p>What I found most challenging was working within concept designs that were incomplete. Oftentimes the
            interactions and flows had glaring flaws. This was a great exercise in team collaboration. It made me
            consider how I would want to communicate with my team about product decisions. It also made me realize how
            important it was to articulate my own design decisions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>What surprised me was seeing the impact of content-early design at the start of a product. The
            mock-ups already existed. But several times I wanted to change the entire layout to make the copy, sections,
            and screen concepts more consistant and clear across flows. It made me appreciate the importance of being
            involved in user research processes, defining the information hierarchy, and developing a content strategy
            as early as possible.</p>
