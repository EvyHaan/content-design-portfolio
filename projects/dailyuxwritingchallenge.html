          <h2>Day 1</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A traveler is in an airport waiting for the last leg of a flight home when their
            flight gets abruptly canceled due to bad weather.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Write a message from the airline app notifying them of the cancellation and
            what
            they need to do next.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Headline: 45 characters</p>
          <p>Body: 175 characters max</p>
          <p>Button(s): 25 characters max</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

              <figcaption>Fig 1. Flight cancellation notification.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>In the headline, I wanted to be direct with the customer about 1) what had happened, and 2) why.
            Understanding why may not necessarily ease frustration. But given more context, a user can have a
            better sense of what to consider when figuring out what to do next.</p>
          <br>
          <p>There are three messages in the body. First, we empathize with the customer. They may be feeling annoyed,
            frustrated, or frantic. I want to acknowledge and validate those feelings.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Next, I tell the user what to do. I let them know they have two options. They can use the app to rebook
            their flight. Or, if they'd be more comfortable speaking with a person to navigate a stressful
            situation, we'd like to respect that preference.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Finally, I offer them something to look forward to.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The button gives them the opportunity to jump straight into rebooking, starting with viewing other flight
            options.</p>
          <!-- Day 2 -->
          <hr>
          <h2>Day 2</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A user is a working parent, and a big sports fan, in the midst of their favorite
            sports season who can no longer attend games.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Write a promotional screen for an app that lets a user choose teams, sends game
            reminders, real-time score updates and highlight videos.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Headline: 40 characters max</p>
          <p>Body: 175 characters max</p>
          <p>Button(s): 25 characters max</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <div class="centered-img-container">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/duxwc/DUXWC_2.svg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 1. Sports app promotional screen.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>With the headline, I wanted to celebrate the user for balancing all they have going on in life while still
            being a devoted fan.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Because, this is a peron without a lot of time, I am direct with the beneifts. I also assure them it's a
            low-effort relationship with the app. Set it and we'll never let you forget it (in a good way).</p>
          <br>
          <p>The CTA cuts right into the action to get them set up.</p>
