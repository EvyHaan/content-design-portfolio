          <!-- Day 1 -->
          <hr>
          <h2>Day 1</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A traveler is in an airport waiting for the last leg of a flight home when their
            flight gets abruptly canceled due to bad weather.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Write a message from the airline app notifying them of the cancellation and
            what
            they need to do next.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Headline: 45 characters</p>
          <p>Body: 175 characters max</p>
          <p>Button(s): 25 characters max</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <div class="centered-img-container">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/duxwc/duxwc_1.svg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 1. Flight cancellation notification.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>In the headline, I wanted to be direct with the customer about 1) what had happened, and 2) why.
            Understanding why may not necessarily ease frustration. But given more context, a user can have a
            better sense of what to consider when figuring out what to do next.</p>
          <br>
          <p>There are three messages in the body. First, we empathize with the customer. They may be feeling annoyed,
            frustrated, or frantic. I want to acknowledge and validate those feelings.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Next, I tell the user what to do. I let them know they have two options. They can use the app to rebook
            their flight. Or, if they'd be more comfortable speaking with a person to navigate a stressful
            situation, we'd like to respect that preference.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Finally, I offer them something to look forward to.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The button gives them the opportunity to jump straight into rebooking, starting with viewing other flight
            options.</p>
          <!-- Day 2 -->
          <hr>
          <h2>Day 2</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A user is a working parent, and a big sports fan, in the midst of their favorite
            sports season who can no longer attend games.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Write a promotional screen for an app that lets a user choose teams, sends game
            reminders, real-time score updates and highlight videos.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Headline: 40 characters max</p>
          <p>Body: 175 characters max</p>
          <p>Button(s): 25 characters max</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <div class="centered-img-container">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/duxwc/duxwc_2.svg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 2. Sports app promotional screen.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>With the headline, I wanted to celebrate the user for balancing all they have going on in life while still
            being a devoted fan.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Because this is a peron without a lot of time, I am direct with the beneifts. I also assure them it's a
            low-effort relationship with the app. Set it and we'll never let you forget it (in a good way).</p>
          <br>
          <p>The CTA cuts right into the action to get them set up.</p>
          <!-- Day 3 -->
          <hr>
          <h2>Day 3</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user entered the wrong email address to sign in to their account.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Tell the user to enter the right email.</p>
          <br>
          <p>40 characters max</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <div class="centered-img-container">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/duxwc/duxwc_3.svg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 3. Incorrect email error microcopy.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>Is it the wrong email? Or is the email wrong? We don't really know. All we know is that it doesn't match
            any email in our database.</p>
          <br>
          <p>So instead I tell the user what the problem is and what to do next. I keep it brief but conversational. The
            tone is direct and neutral, not negative or accusatory.</p>

          <!-- Day 4 -->
          <hr>
          <h2>Day 4</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A user is in their favorite supermarket. They open the supermarket’s app on
            their phone to see what’s on sale and are greeted by a promotion.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Write a promotional home screen for a subscription service that delivers
            groceries to the user once-a-month for a flat fee.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Headline: 45 characters max</p>
          <p>Body: 175 characters max</p>
          <p>Button(s): 25 characters max</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <div class="centered-img-container">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/duxwc/duxwc_4.svg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 4. Subscription promotion interstitial.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>A shopper may have any number of reasons why they might like outsourcing their grocery shopping. I didn't
            want to project generic speculative situations like "don't have time for shopping?" because they may or may
            not relate. So instead, in the headline, I just let them know grocery shopping is something we'd be excited
            to do for them, for whatever reason they may need it.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The body could have gone two directions: tell them more about the beneifts or address questions about how
            (not) complicated it is to use the service. I went with the later. I try to answer the immediate questions
            like "when would I get my groceries?" and "can I still use coupons?". Knowing how easy the set up is
            might sway someone to tap the sign up button right away.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Still, I offer the first button for this kind of scenario: the user opens the app while they are in the
            store. They're not going to sign up for a grocery shoppin service while they are already mid-shopping. But
            they may want to be reminded of it when the open the app at home.</p>
          <!-- Day 5 -->
          <hr>
          <h2>Day 5</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user works in graphic design. While critiquing a design in a mobile app,
            their phone abruptly turns off. When they restart the phone, they reopen the app.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Write a message that the user will read immediately upon opening the app. What
            do they need to know? What steps (if any) do they need to take to recover their content? What if they can't
            recover the content? </p>
          <br>
          <p>Headline: 40 characters max</p>
          <p>Body: 140 characters max</p>
          <p>Button(s): 20 characters max</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <div class="centered-img-container">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/duxwc/duxwc_5a.svg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 5a. Unrecoverable error.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          <div class="centered-img-container">
            <figure>
              <img class="framed" src="../images/duxwc/duxwc_5b.svg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 5b. Saved progress message.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>In the first version, I address a situation where the user's work is permanantly lost. I wanted to be
            upfront with the user and let them know this fact without fluffing it up. This can be extremely frustrating.
            While there isn't anything that we can do to resolve the current issue, I felt it was important to assure
            them we do care and are concerned by the issue. It is important to let the know the problem is being worked
            on and their insight can help us prevent it from happening again. Because that's the action I'd most like
            them to take, "File A Report" is the primary action. </p>
          <br>
          <p>In the second version, I address a situation where their work was recovered. The tone is a little more
            relaxed. However, I still want to reassure them that we are addressing the issue, and any information they
            provide would be helpful. Their work is safe, but the whole circumstance is still an inconvenient
            interruption that is in everyone's interest to fix. In the primary action, they can get straight back to
            work, but we still offer the option to send us a report if they are willing.</p>
          <!-- Day 6 -->
          <hr>
          <h2>Day 6</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> It’s Monday. A user has just gotten into their car to drive to work. They plug
            their phone into the car and start driving.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> How would you let the user know there’s a fire happening in a nearby town that
            is causing road closures? The effect on their commute is unknown, but there is a definite danger if the fire
            gets closer. How do you communicate this to them? When? Write it.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Headline: 30 characters max</p>
          <p>Body: 45 characters max</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <div class="centered-img-container">
            <figure>
              <img src="../images/duxwc/duxwc_6.jpg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 6. Navigation alert.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>A push notification is the best way to relay an alert to a user as it does not require them to unlock their
            phone or open an app. They see (or hear or feel, depending on sound and haptic preferences) it right
            away. If the user is driving, they can only afford a glance, so the information must be succint and direct.
            This notification was designed with the idea that a user may tap it to open their navigation app which
            might suggest alternative routes with estimated commute times and/or visually display.</p>
          <br>
          <!-- Day 7 -->
          <hr>
          <h2>Day 7</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A sports fan is at a wedding while their favorite team is playing against their
            arch-rivals. Their team scores.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> How would you, quickly, let the sports fan know about the latest play, the
            current score, and the key players? Write it.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Headline: 30 characters max</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="../images/duxwc/duxwc_7.jpg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 7. Sports app push notification.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>For an at-a-glance update, a push notification is the best way to reach the user. I started with an
            exclamation "Goal!" so the user knows what has happened. Then I give the current score so they have context.
            This is one space I feel like using jargon can be appropriate - fans of the sport are likely
            already familiar enough with the specialized or slang terminology which helps describe the gist of the play.

          <!-- Day 8 -->
          <hr>
          <h2>Day 8</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user is a casual music fan and (on occasion) goes to live concerts. They
            have a music player app on their phone.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Tell the user that one of their favorite bands is playing live in their town.
            How would you compel them to want to go?</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="../images/duxwc/duxwc_8.jpg" />
              <figcaption>Fig 8. In-app performance promotion</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>For this challenge, I modeled my design from Apple Music which is my personal go-to music app. I considered
            the components in place already from what I could gather of the design system for the app.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The most important things to user to help them decide if they would like to go is the band name, the date
            and time, and the location. While I considered adding catchy body text to include either a recognizable
            lyric or ideas that embody the band (emerald jumpers and keytars), I wanted to keep the replicability of the
            design easy, including the formatting and pattern of the text.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The date is somewhat reiterated in the title, but in an easier way for the user to process as upcoming
            soon.</p>
          <br>
          <p>While the playlist, song, artist, and special features cards throughout the rest of the app ARE buttons, I
            chose to use a link below the card for "Get Tickets". This was to avoid the user having problems
            accidentally tapping into the order tickets screen while scrolling or fumbling with phone and keys and
            whatever else in hand because of the large tappable area. Using the link below minimizes the risk, helps it
            stand out, and may serve as a signal that it may link to a different app or website. </p>

          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user is trying to rent a car using an application but the credit card on
            file has expired.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Write them an error message so that they can correct the problem.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Error message microcopy should be straightforward. This tells the user exactly what the problem is, and
            provides them two options for next steps.</p>

          <br>
          <p>While it's clear to me why the user's location is valuable here, it's not so clear why I need their first

          <p>In the meantime, I supposed this information may be used to begin a user account. The body conveys to the
            user that once provided, they can then begin favoriting cars in their area they'd like to consider. The
            language is simple and honest in what the information will be used for.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Prior to asking for the user's first name, however, the title conveys a tone of familiarity and camraderie
            by using the first person plural language. A user might be excited by the prospect or dread the process
            getting a car, and the voice of the website is open to support the customer through the process.

          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> An elderly user is doing a Google search to find an easy way to buy contact
            lenses online.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Write a title and meta description for a website that sells subscription
            contact lenses delivered to a user every 30 days—convince them to try it.</p>

          </div>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>I want to give the user as much information as possible, in a seemingly impossibly small space. An elderly
            user might be concerned about price, hidden costs, if their insurance or medicare is accepted, getting
            trapped in bad commitment, and whether they can find the brand and type they are familiar with using.</p>
          <br>
          <p>First, I try to draw in their attention to the benefit of a monthly subscription. They will have a supply
            ready to go for the whole month, worry-free and hassle-free. The company name is also in the title for SEO
            searchability.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Next I try to address as many of their questions as possible. While keeping in mind this search is
            specifically by an elderly user, it could just as well be a search by any other demographic. This means I
            still want to keep the information relatively general. An example of where I broaden the language
            is to include "We bill your insurance directly. The goal here is to indicate the company will interface
            directly with insurers in general. It's an invitation for the user to look into the site deeper or talk to a
            representative about more specific insurance questions.
